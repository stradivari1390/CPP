# C++ Programming Repository

This repository contains a collection of various C++ programs developed during my time at the university with C++98/C++03 and here refactored to C++11. These programs cover a wide range of topics in computer science including arrays, graphs, algorithms, and more.

## Contents

- **Arrays**: Programs that demonstrate manipulation and processing of array data structures.
- **Graphs**: Programs that work with graph data structures, including graph traversal algorithms.
- **Laboratory Works**: A collection of programs developed for lab assignments. These programs cover various topics and apply different programming concepts.
- **And More**: This repository also contains many other programs that cover different aspects of programming in C++. I will extend definition later.

## Usage

Most of the programs can be run directly from the command line after compiling. For example, to compile and run a program:
```
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```
Please read the individual program descriptions for more information on what each program does and how to interact with it.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a record of my university coursework, contributions and suggestions for improvement are always welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your suggestions or submit a pull request.
